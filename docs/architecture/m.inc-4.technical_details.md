# Blaise Agüera y Arcas’ BFF Experiment – Technical Details

## Tape Concatenation and Execution Cycle

In Blaise Agüera y Arcas’ BFF experiment, the “world” (or _soup_) contains many programs, each a fixed 64-byte sequence. During each interaction, two 64-byte tapes are randomly selected and concatenated end-to-end into a single 128-byte tape, which is then executed as one program[nautil.us](https://nautil.us/in-the-beginning-there-was-computation-787023/#:~:text=In%20our%20version%2C%20which%20we,cosmic%20rays%20do%20to%20DNA). In other words, if program A and B are chosen, they form a combined tape `AB` (128 bytes long) which the system treats as one contiguous memory for execution. The BFF interpreter runs this 128-byte tape for a set number of steps or until the program halts, allowing the code on the first half to operate on (and potentially modify) the second half, and vice versa[nautil.us](https://nautil.us/in-the-beginning-there-was-computation-787023/#:~:text=length%E2%80%9464%20bytes%E2%80%94and%20start%20off%20filled,cosmic%20rays%20do%20to%20DNA)[note.com](https://note.com/yuya_fujiwara/n/n3495b5479f61#:~:text=%E5%8E%9F%E5%A7%8B%E3%82%B9%E3%83%BC%E3%83%97%E3%80%8D%E3%82%92%E5%BD%A2%E6%88%90%E3%81%97%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82%E5%90%84%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AF64%E5%80%8B%E3%81%AE1%E3%83%90%E3%82%A4%E3%83%88%E6%96%87%E5%AD%97%E3%81%A7%E6%A7%8B%E6%88%90%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%80%81%E4%B8%80%E6%A7%98%E5%88%86%E5%B8%83%E3%81%8B%E3%82%89%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%83%80%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AB%E5%88%9D%E6%9C%9F%E5%8C%96%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82%E3%81%93%E3%82%8C%E3%82%89%E3%81%AE%E3%82%B7%E3%83%9F%E3%83%A5%E3%83%AC%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3%E3%81%A7%E3%81%AF%E3%80%81%E6%96%B0%E3%81%97%E3%81%84%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AF%E7%94%9F%20%E6%88%90%E3%82%82%E5%89%8A%E9%99%A4%E3%82%82%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%81%BE%E3%81%9B%E3%82%93%20%E2%80%93%20%E5%A4%89%E5%8C%96%E3%81%AF%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E4%BF%AE%E6%AD%A3%E3%81%BE%E3%81%9F%E3%81%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%83%80%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AA%E8%83%8C%E6%99%AF%E7%AA%81%E7%84%B6%E5%A4%89%E7%95%B0%E3%81%AB%E3%82%88%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A6%E3%81%AE%E3%81%BF%E7%99%BA%E7%94%9F%E3%81%97%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82%E5%90%84%E3%82%A8%E3%83%9D%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%81%A7%E3%80%81%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%83%80%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AB%E9%81%B8%E6%8A%9E%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%81%9F%E9%A0%86%E5%BA%8F%E4%BB%98%E3%81%8D%E3%83%9A%E3%82%A2%E3%81%A7%E7%9B%B8%E4%BA%92%E4%BD%9C%E7%94%A8%20%E3%81%97%E3%80%81%E3%81%9D%E3%82%8C%E3%82%89%E3%82%92%E9%80%A3%E7%B5%90%E3%81%97%E3%81%A6%E7%B5%90%E6%9E%9C%E3%81%AE%E3%82%B3%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%82%92%E5%9B%BA%E5%AE%9A%E3%82%B9%E3%83%86%E3%83%83%E3%83%97%E6%95%B0%E3%81%BE%E3%81%9F%E3%81%AF%E7%B5%82%E4%BA%86%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E3%81%BE%E3%81%A7%E5%AE%9F%E8%A1%8C%E3%81%97%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82%E6%88%91%E3%80%85%E3%81%AE%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%9F%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E8%A8%80%E8%AA%9E%E3%81%AF%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0%E8%87%AA%E4%BD%93%E3%81%A7%E3%81%82%E3%82%8B%E5%90%8C%E3%81%98%E3%83%86%E3%83%BC%E3%83%97%E4%B8%8A%E3%81%A7%E8%AA%AD%E3%81%BF%E6%9B%B8%E3%81%8D%E3%82%92%E8%A1%8C%E3%81%86%E3%81%9F%E3%82%81%E3%80%81%E3%81%93,%E3%82%8C%E3%82%89%E3%81%AE%E5%AE%9F%E8%A1%8C%E3%81%AF%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%E7%9A%84%E3%81%AB%E4%B8%A1%E6%96%B9%E3%81%AE%E5%88%9D%E6%9C%9F%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0%E3%82%92%E4%BF%AE%E6%AD%A3%E3%81%97%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82%E6%9C%80%E5%BE%8C%E3%81%AB%E3%80%81%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AF%E5%88%86%E9%9B%A2%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%80%81%E5%B0%86%E6%9D%A5%E3%81%AE%E6%A4%9C%E8%A8%8E%E3%81%AE%E3%81%9F%E3%82%81%E3%81%AB%E3%82%B9%E3%83%BC%E3%83%97%E3%81%AB%E6%88%BB%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82). After execution, the tape is “split” back into two 64-byte halves, which are placed back into the population (now possibly altered by the interaction). This models a “reaction” where two programs interact and produce two (potentially modified) offspring programs[nautil.us](https://nautil.us/in-the-beginning-there-was-computation-787023/#:~:text=length%E2%80%9464%20bytes%E2%80%94and%20start%20off%20filled,cosmic%20rays%20do%20to%20DNA)[note.com](https://note.com/yuya_fujiwara/n/n3495b5479f61#:~:text=%24%24,%284). Periodically, random mutations (random byte flips) are also introduced as noise, analogous to cosmic rays flipping bits[nautil.us](https://nautil.us/in-the-beginning-there-was-computation-787023/#:~:text=length%E2%80%9464%20bytes%E2%80%94and%20start%20off%20filled,cosmic%20rays%20do%20to%20DNA).

Importantly, the two halves remain contiguous during execution – there is no barrier at the 64-byte boundary. This means the program’s memory pointer can move freely across the boundary from the first tape into the second. Any modifications the program makes in memory can therefore affect either its “own” code or the partner tape’s code. In effect, concatenation allows one program to copy itself into the other’s space (a key step in self-replication). After execution, each 64-byte segment, now possibly changed, is treated as an independent program again. This concatenation–execution–split cycle repeats millions of times, driving an evolutionary process. Initially the random 64-byte programs do very little (most bytes aren’t valid instructions), but after enough interactions, replicating code evolves and spreads through the soup[nautil.us](https://nautil.us/in-the-beginning-there-was-computation-787023/#:~:text=Since%20bff%20has%20only%20seven,by%20the%20execution%20of%20a)[nautil.us](https://nautil.us/in-the-beginning-there-was-computation-787023/#:~:text=But%20after%20a%20few%20million,into%20the%20hundreds%2C%20at%20minimum).

## Brainfuck-Based BFF Interpreter Architecture

The BFF interpreter is a modified Brainfuck machine that executes the combined 128-byte tape. In traditional Brainfuck (BF), there is an instruction pointer (for code) and a data pointer moving on a separate memory tape. BFF collapses this distinction: it uses a _single tape for both code and data_, enabling self-modifying code[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19108#:~:text=it%20onerous%20for%20humans%20to,pointer%20starts%20at%20zero%20and). Additionally, BFF introduces a second data pointer so that two locations on the tape can be accessed at once. Concretely, BFF has three pointers that all operate on the same tape memory:

- Instruction Pointer (IP): Points to the current instruction being executed (starts at position 0 of the 128-byte combined tape).
- Head0 (Read Head): A pointer used for most data operations (analogous to BF’s data pointer). It starts at 0 (the tape start) by default.
- Head1 (Write Head): A second data pointer (starts at 0 as well). This is used as a target or source in the new copy instructions.

All three pointers index into the _same_ 128-byte array representing the tape[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19108#:~:text=where%20the%20data%20and%20instruction,operation.%20The%20complete). In each execution step, the BFF interpreter reads the byte under the IP and interprets it as an instruction (if it’s not a defined opcode, it’s treated as a no-op). After executing the instruction, the IP moves to the next byte (unless the instruction was a jump). The key difference from ordinary Brainfuck is that input/output are removed and replaced with operations that copy data _within the tape_. This allows programs to interact with their own code or data rather than an external stream[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19108#:~:text=it%20onerous%20for%20humans%20to,pointer%20starts%20at%20zero%20and)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19108#:~:text=,after%20a%20fixed%20number%20of).

BFF Instruction Set: BFF extends the 8 commands of Brainfuck to a 10-command set by repurposing BF’s I/O and adding new pointer moves. Every byte value 0–255 is valid in memory, but only a small subset correspond to active instructions (others do nothing). The seven core commands that Blaise often mentions (`< > + - [ ] , .`) are augmented with curly braces `{ }` for the second pointer. In summary, the BFF operations are:

- `<` – Move head0 one cell to the left (decrement head0 index)[note.com](https://note.com/yuya_fujiwara/n/n3495b5479f61#:~:text=%3C%20head0%20%3D%20head0%20,head1)

_BFF instruction set and semantics[note.com](https://note.com/yuya_fujiwara/n/n3495b5479f61#:~:text=%3C%20head0%20%3D%20head0%20,command)[note.com](https://note.com/yuya_fujiwara/n/n3495b5479f61#:~:text=,command)._ Non-listed byte values act as no-ops (they are simply ignored during execution). Brackets `[...]` serve as conditional loops, as in Brainfuck, and they can nest. If a loop bracket has no matching partner, the program terminates[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19108#:~:text=.%20tape,after%20a%20fixed%20number%20of). In BFF, the program also stops if it executes a fixed maximum number of instructions (e.g. 2^13 = 8192 steps) to prevent infinite runs[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19108#:~:text=,Note).

Execution of the Combined Tape: When the 128-byte tape is run under this instruction set, the single instruction pointer marches through the code, while `head0` and `head1` move along the same tape acting as source and destination pointers. For example, the `.` instruction takes whatever byte value is under head0 and writes it to the cell under head1[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19108#:~:text=,after%20a%20fixed%20number%20of). Because head1 might be positioned far away (even in the other half of the tape), this is effectively how a program can write into another program’s memory (or into its own future instruction space). The `,` instruction does the reverse copy[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19108#:~:text=,after%20a%20fixed%20number%20of). Together, `.` and `,` replace the role of I/O in standard BF with internal data transfer – they make the tape a _von Neumann architecture_ (program can treat its code as data). Notably, both heads start at 0 (the left end of the combined tape) in the basic primordial soup setup[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/seancarroll/comments/1ew2l3l/discussion_episode_286_blaise_ag%C3%BCera_y_arcas_on/#:~:text=Here%27s%20the%20actual%20paper%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Farxiv). This means initially both heads point to the start of the first 64-byte segment, but the program’s instructions can move them independently. Often a self-replicator will move head0 over its own bytes and head1 to an empty region (like the partner’s half), then use the copy instructions to duplicate itself.

## Self-Modification and Replication Mechanism

BFF’s design explicitly allows self-modifying code. Since _the code _is__ the data tape*, any operation that writes to memory (e.g. `+`, `-`, `.` or `,`) can alter the program’s _own instructions_. For example, a BFF program could use `head0` to point at an instruction ahead of the current IP and use `+` to change that instruction’s byte value before it is executed. In practice, the emergent replicators use the two-head system primarily to copy code from one location to another on the tape. A self-replicator might use a loop to iterate over its 64-byte sequence (using head0 as the read index) and use `.` at each step to write that byte to head1’s position, which it incrementally moves along the target region[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19108#:~:text=,after%20a%20fixed%20number%20of). This effectively copies the entire program to a new location on the tape. Because in an interaction the “new location” is often the partner tape, this produces a clone of itself in the neighboring tape. After the 128-byte execution, that neighbor half now contains a copy of the replicator, which means the replicator successfully reproduced[nautil.us](https://nautil.us/in-the-beginning-there-was-computation-787023/#:~:text=end%20to%20end%2C%20creating%20a,cosmic%20rays%20do%20to%20DNA)[note.com](https://note.com/yuya_fujiwara/n/n3495b5479f61#:~:text=%24%24,%284).

It’s important that no external input or output is involved – all changes happen through self-inspection and self-writing. Initially, most interactions don’t do anything interesting: only ~2.7% of bytes are valid instructions by random chance, so executions perform only a few operations and often have no lasting effect[nautil.us](https://nautil.us/in-the-beginning-there-was-computation-787023/#:~:text=Since%20bff%20has%20only%20seven,by%20the%20execution%20of%20a). But occasionally an operation will flip a bit in a useful way (e.g. mutate a no-op into a `[` or other instruction). If by chance a sequence arises that can copy itself, it will start populating the soup with duplicates of its code – these _self-modifying, self-copying sequences_ are the emergent self-replicators. As noted in the paper, self-modification (via the unified tape and head operations) is the crucial mechanism that allows replicators to emerge even without any explicit fitness function[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381770386_Computational_Life_How_Well-formed_Self-replicating_Programs_Emerge_from_Simple_Interaction#:~:text=landscape%2C%20nevertheless%20give)[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381770386_Computational_Life_How_Well-formed_Self-replicating_Programs_Emerge_from_Simple_Interaction#:~:text=rise%20to%20self,modi%EF%AC%81cation%20and%20this%20can).

During execution, both halves of the 128-byte tape can be altered. BFF programs have no built-in notion of protecting one half or the other; the distinction “first tape vs second tape” is only an external view. Internally it’s one contiguous memory. Thus an interaction often results in _both_ original programs being partially overwritten (they form a chimera). The experiment’s results showed a phase where imperfect replicators copy over each other chaotically, creating mixed fragments, until eventually a stable whole-tape replicator architecture emerges that consistently produces exact copies of itself[nautil.us](https://nautil.us/in-the-beginning-there-was-computation-787023/#:~:text=But%20after%20a%20few%20million,into%20the%20hundreds%2C%20at%20minimum)[nautil.us](https://nautil.us/in-the-beginning-there-was-computation-787023/#:~:text=The%20code%20is%20no%20longer,can%20%E2%80%9Cfail%E2%80%9D%E2%80%94even%20though%20nobody%20designed). This signifies the tape’s code has evolved to reliably use the self-modifying instructions to reproduce.

Heads and Self-Move: In some BFF variants, researchers experimented with whether the two heads should start at the same position or offset (to avoid trivial self-copies). For example, a “noheads” variant of BFF was used in the code (invoked as `--lang bff_noheads`) – despite the name, it still conceptually has head0 and head1, but may treat them differently at start. The published code mentions that if head0 and head1 start both at 0 on a long tape, trivial non-looping self-replicators dominate, whereas giving head1 an initial offset (like 12 or 16 bytes away) forces more complex (looping) replicators to evolve[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381770386_Computational_Life_How_Well-formed_Self-replicating_Programs_Emerge_from_Simple_Interaction#:~:text=%E2%80%99s%20initial%20positions)[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381770386_Computational_Life_How_Well-formed_Self-replicating_Programs_Emerge_from_Simple_Interaction#:~:text=universe,Anecdotally%2C%20we%20appear). The specific “BFF_noheads” mode likely sets head0=head1 (or otherwise limits the second head), making it closer to a single-head machine for that experiment. This was used to validate that looping replicators still arise under slightly different conditions[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381770386_Computational_Life_How_Well-formed_Self-replicating_Programs_Emerge_from_Simple_Interaction#:~:text=%E2%80%99s%20initial%20positions).

## Implementation and Code Artifacts

The BFF experiment was implemented in C++ and CUDA in an open-source project called CuBFF (for “CUDA BFF”). The code is available in the `paradigms-of-intelligence/cubff` GitHub repository[github.com](https://github.com/paradigms-of-intelligence/cubff#:~:text=CuBFF). This implementation allows running the BFF “soup” simulation either on CPU or GPU. In fact, _most of the experiments in the “Computational Life” paper were conducted with this codebase_[github.com](https://github.com/paradigms-of-intelligence/cubff#:~:text=CuBFF). The repository contains variants for other “computational substrates” as well (e.g. Forth, Z80, SUBLEQ), but the BFF implementation is central. The core BFF interpreter logic is in the file `bff.cu` (with GPU parallelism) and a CPU equivalent. Key features of the implementation:

- It maintains an array of N 64-byte tapes in memory (for example, N=8,192 in some runs[note.com](https://note.com/yuya_fujiwara/n/n3495b5479f61#:~:text=%E6%9C%AC%E8%AB%96%E6%96%87%E3%81%A7%E4%B8%BB%E3%81%AB%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E3%82%B7%E3%83%9F%E3%83%A5%E3%83%AC%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3%E3%81%AF%E3%80%81Fontana%5B20%5D%E3%81%AETuring%E3%82%AC%E3%82%B9%E3%81%AE%E5%A4%89%E7%A8%AE%E3%81%A7%E3%81%99%E3%80%82%E3%81%93%E3%81%AE%E3%82%AC%E3%82%B9%E3%81%A7%E3%81%AF%E3%80%81%E5%A4%A7%E9%87%8F%E3%81%AE%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0%EF%BC%88%E9%80%9A%E5%B8%B8%24%24%7B2,%E3%81%97%E3%80%81%E3%81%9D%E3%82%8C%E3%82%89%E3%82%92%E9%80%A3%E7%B5%90%E3%81%97%E3%81%A6%E7%B5%90%E6%9E%9C%E3%81%AE%E3%82%B3%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%82%92%E5%9B%BA%E5%AE%9A%E3%82%B9%E3%83%86%E3%83%83%E3%83%97%E6%95%B0%E3%81%BE%E3%81%9F%E3%81%AF%E7%B5%82%E4%BA%86%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E3%81%BE%E3%81%A7%E5%AE%9F%E8%A1%8C%E3%81%97%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82%E6%88%91%E3%80%85%E3%81%AE%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%9F%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E8%A8%80%E8%AA%9E%E3%81%AF%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0%E8%87%AA%E4%BD%93%E3%81%A7%E3%81%82%E3%82%8B%E5%90%8C%E3%81%98%E3%83%86%E3%83%BC%E3%83%97%E4%B8%8A%E3%81%A7%E8%AA%AD%E3%81%BF%E6%9B%B8%E3%81%8D%E3%82%92%E8%A1%8C%E3%81%86%E3%81%9F%E3%82%81%E3%80%81%E3%81%93%20%E3%82%8C%E3%82%89%E3%81%AE%E5%AE%9F%E8%A1%8C%E3%81%AF%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%E7%9A%84%E3%81%AB%E4%B8%A1%E6%96%B9%E3%81%AE%E5%88%9D%E6%9C%9F%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0%E3%82%92%E4%BF%AE%E6%AD%A3%E3%81%97%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82%E6%9C%80%E5%BE%8C%E3%81%AB%E3%80%81%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AF%E5%88%86%E9%9B%A2%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%80%81%E5%B0%86%E6%9D%A5%E3%81%AE%E6%A4%9C%E8%A8%8E%E3%81%AE%E3%81%9F%E3%82%81%E3%81%AB%E3%82%B9%E3%83%BC%E3%83%97%E3%81%AB%E6%88%BB%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82)). These are the individuals in the soup, initialized with random bytes.
- It uses a loop to perform random pairwise interactions. In each interaction, two tapes are chosen (either truly randomly or in some schedule). The 64-byte sequences are concatenated (essentially just handling them as contiguous memory segments of length 128).
- The BFF interpreter runs on that 128-byte tape. In GPU mode, many interactions are executed in parallel – e.g. thousands of thread blocks each pick random pairs and simulate their 128-byte execution concurrently, to accelerate the experiment.
- After execution, the 128-byte result is split back into two 64-byte segments. These segments overwrite the original two individuals in the population array[note.com](https://note.com/yuya_fujiwara/n/n3495b5479f61#:~:text=%E5%8E%9F%E5%A7%8B%E3%82%B9%E3%83%BC%E3%83%97%E3%80%8D%E3%82%92%E5%BD%A2%E6%88%90%E3%81%97%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82%E5%90%84%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AF64%E5%80%8B%E3%81%AE1%E3%83%90%E3%82%A4%E3%83%88%E6%96%87%E5%AD%97%E3%81%A7%E6%A7%8B%E6%88%90%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%80%81%E4%B8%80%E6%A7%98%E5%88%86%E5%B8%83%E3%81%8B%E3%82%89%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%83%80%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AB%E5%88%9D%E6%9C%9F%E5%8C%96%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82%E3%81%93%E3%82%8C%E3%82%89%E3%81%AE%E3%82%B7%E3%83%9F%E3%83%A5%E3%83%AC%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3%E3%81%A7%E3%81%AF%E3%80%81%E6%96%B0%E3%81%97%E3%81%84%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AF%E7%94%9F%20%E6%88%90%E3%82%82%E5%89%8A%E9%99%A4%E3%82%82%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%81%BE%E3%81%9B%E3%82%93%20%E2%80%93%20%E5%A4%89%E5%8C%96%E3%81%AF%E8%87%AA%E5%B7%B1%E4%BF%AE%E6%AD%A3%E3%81%BE%E3%81%9F%E3%81%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%83%80%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AA%E8%83%8C%E6%99%AF%E7%AA%81%E7%84%B6%E5%A4%89%E7%95%B0%E3%81%AB%E3%82%88%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A6%E3%81%AE%E3%81%BF%E7%99%BA%E7%94%9F%E3%81%97%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82%E5%90%84%E3%82%A8%E3%83%9D%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%81%A7%E3%80%81%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%83%B3%E3%83%80%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AB%E9%81%B8%E6%8A%9E%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%81%9F%E9%A0%86%E5%BA%8F%E4%BB%98%E3%81%8D%E3%83%9A%E3%82%A2%E3%81%A7%E7%9B%B8%E4%BA%92%E4%BD%9C%E7%94%A8%20%E3%81%97%E3%80%81%E3%81%9D%E3%82%8C%E3%82%89%E3%82%92%E9%80%A3%E7%B5%90%E3%81%97%E3%81%A6%E7%B5%90%E6%9E%9C%E3%81%AE%E3%82%B3%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%82%92%E5%9B%BA%E5%AE%9A%E3%82%B9%E3%83%86%E3%83%83%E3%83%97%E6%95%B0%E3%81%BE%E3%81%9F%E3%81%AF%E7%B5%82%E4%BA%86%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E3%81%BE%E3%81%A7%E5%AE%9F%E8%A1%8C%E3%81%97%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82%E6%88%91%E3%80%85%E3%81%AE%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%9F%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E8%A8%80%E8%AA%9E%E3%81%AF%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0%E8%87%AA%E4%BD%93%E3%81%A7%E3%81%82%E3%82%8B%E5%90%8C%E3%81%98%E3%83%86%E3%83%BC%E3%83%97%E4%B8%8A%E3%81%A7%E8%AA%AD%E3%81%BF%E6%9B%B8%E3%81%8D%E3%82%92%E8%A1%8C%E3%81%86%E3%81%9F%E3%82%81%E3%80%81%E3%81%93,%E3%82%8C%E3%82%89%E3%81%AE%E5%AE%9F%E8%A1%8C%E3%81%AF%E4%B8%80%E8%88%AC%E7%9A%84%E3%81%AB%E4%B8%A1%E6%96%B9%E3%81%AE%E5%88%9D%E6%9C%9F%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0%E3%82%92%E4%BF%AE%E6%AD%A3%E3%81%97%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82%E6%9C%80%E5%BE%8C%E3%81%AB%E3%80%81%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0%E3%81%AF%E5%88%86%E9%9B%A2%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%80%81%E5%B0%86%E6%9D%A5%E3%81%AE%E6%A4%9C%E8%A8%8E%E3%81%AE%E3%81%9F%E3%82%81%E3%81%AB%E3%82%B9%E3%83%BC%E3%83%97%E3%81%AB%E6%88%BB%E3%81%95%E3%82%8C%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82)[note.com](https://note.com/yuya_fujiwara/n/n3495b5479f61#:~:text=%24%24,%284). Any changes that occurred in those segments thus persist into the next “generation” of the soup.
- A global step counter tracks how many interactions have happened. The code may periodically check for termination conditions or perform mutations. The implementation injects random mutations by flipping a byte in the soup occasionally (this can be done each interaction with low probability, or every fixed number of steps, simulating background radiation)[nautil.us](https://nautil.us/in-the-beginning-there-was-computation-787023/#:~:text=end%20to%20end%2C%20creating%20a,cosmic%20rays%20do%20to%20DNA).
- There is no explicit fitness evaluation in code – selection is entirely implicit (programs that self-replicate end up populating more of the soup simply by copying themselves). To keep population size constant, the code naturally overwrites tapes without adding new ones (the `exec(AB) -> A' + B'` split replaces the old A and B with new versions)[note.com](https://note.com/yuya_fujiwara/n/n3495b5479f61#:~:text=%E4%BB%BB%E6%84%8F%E3%81%AE2%E3%81%A4%E3%81%AE%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0%EF%BC%88A%E3%81%A8B%EF%BC%89%E3%81%AE%E9%96%93%E3%81%AE%E7%9B%B8%E4%BA%92%E4%BD%9C%E7%94%A8%E3%82%92%E3%80%81%E9%A0%86%E5%BA%8F%E3%81%8C%E9%87%8D%E8%A6%81%E3%81%AA%E4%B8%8D%E5%8F%AF%E9%80%86%E3%81%AA%E5%8C%96%E5%AD%A6%E5%8F%8D%E5%BF%9C%E3%81%A8%E3%81%97%E3%81%A6%E8%A7%A3%E9%87%88%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E3%81%93%E3%81%A8%E3%81%8C%E3%81%A7%E3%81%8D%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82%E3%81%93%E3%82%8C%E3%81%AF%E3%80%81A%E3%81%A8B%E3%81%A8%E7%9B%B8%E4%BA%92%E4%BD%9C%E7%94%A8%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E8%A7%A6%E5%AA%92a%E3%81%A8b%E3%81%AE%E4%B8%80%E6%A7%98%E5%88%86%E5%B8%83%E3%82%92%E6%8C%81%20%E3%81%A4%E3%82%82%E3%81%AE%E3%81%A8%E3%81%97%E3%81%A6%E8%A8%98%E8%BF%B0%E3%81%A7%E3%81%8D%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%EF%BC%9A).

Code Example – Self-Replication Loop: Although the actual evolving code is generated by the simulation itself, we can reason about what a self-replicator’s BFF “program” looks like in code terms. A simplified example (in pseudocode using the BFF ops) would be:

```pgsql
>}[>>}]    ; move head0 to start of source (itself), head1 to start of target (partner tape)
[          ; loop begin (while tape[head0] != 0)
.          ; copy byte at head0 to head1  (target[current] = source[current])
}          ; move write head1 right (target index++)
>          ; move read head0 right  (source index++)
]          ; if tape[head0] != 0, jump back to '[' (continue loop)
```

This is an illustrative snippet: it sets head0 to the beginning of its own code and head1 to the beginning of the other half, then enters a loop to copy byte by byte. Real evolved replicators might be more complex (handling zero-bytes, using offsets, etc.), but the CuBFF interpreter executes such loops by updating the `head0` and `head1` indices and using the `.`/`,` instructions to move bytes on the unified tape. The _self-modification_ is evident – the program above writes into the tape positions that correspond to the other program’s code. After the loop, the partner tape would contain a duplicate of the source program.

Engineering Notes: Blaise and collaborators have discussed this system in various forums. In a podcast, Blaise noted that _“in my version of Brainfuck, there are seven instructions”_ and that instead of I/O they use three heads (instruction, read, write) all on one tape[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/seancarroll/comments/1ew2l3l/discussion_episode_286_blaise_ag%C3%BCera_y_arcas_on/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20%201y%20ago)[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/seancarroll/comments/1ew2l3l/discussion_episode_286_blaise_ag%C3%BCera_y_arcas_on/#:~:text=Here%27s%20the%20actual%20paper%3A%20https%3A%2F%2Farxiv). The instruction head progresses automatically through the code bytes, while the other two heads are moved explicitly by `{` `}` `<` `>` opcodes. One Reddit discussion clarified that head0 and head1 both start at position 0 of the combined tape for each interaction, and that the `.` and `,` operations apply to the pointed cells on the tape (not to an external stream)[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/seancarroll/comments/1ew2l3l/discussion_episode_286_blaise_ag%C3%BCera_y_arcas_on/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20%201y%20ago)[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/seancarroll/comments/1ew2l3l/discussion_episode_286_blaise_ag%C3%BCera_y_arcas_on/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20%201y%20ago). This design means any output of one program is actually written into the memory of the other. Over many iterations, this yielded the observed transition from “random noise” to complex, evolved programs that self-reproduce[nautil.us](https://nautil.us/in-the-beginning-there-was-computation-787023/#:~:text=But%20after%20a%20few%20million,into%20the%20hundreds%2C%20at%20minimum)[nautil.us](https://nautil.us/in-the-beginning-there-was-computation-787023/#:~:text=The%20code%20is%20no%20longer,can%20%E2%80%9Cfail%E2%80%9D%E2%80%94even%20though%20nobody%20designed).

The CuBFF code provides full transparency into this process. For instance, the README notes it’s an “implementation of a self-modifying soup of programs” and can be run with a simple command-line invocation (e.g. `bin/main --lang bff_noheads`)[github.com](https://github.com/paradigms-of-intelligence/cubff#:~:text=CuBFF)[github.com](https://github.com/paradigms-of-intelligence/cubff#:~:text=Compile%20the%20code%20by%20running,enabled%20version%29%20or%20%60make%20CUDA%3D0). One can inspect files like `bff.inc.h` or `bff_perm.cu` in the repo for the low-level interpreter loop. The code shows how each opcode is handled – typically via a `switch` or lookup table for the 256 possible byte values. For example, the code implements the _copy to head1_ operation (`.`) by something equivalent to `tape[head1] = tape[head0]`, and implements `}` by `head1++` (with wraparound or boundary checks for the tape length). The bracket instructions are handled by jump tables or by maintaining a stack to find the matching bracket at runtime (similar to standard BF interpreters). In BFF’s case, because the tape can be modified during execution, the jump targets are determined by the original code positions but remain valid even if the bytes in between change (the loop structure is static per execution).

In summary, BFF’s implementation concatenates two 64-byte programs into one 128-byte tape and interprets it with a Brainfuck-derived self-modifying interpreter. The unified tape and dual-pointer architecture let the programs read and write each other’s code as data[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19108#:~:text=it%20onerous%20for%20humans%20to,pointer%20starts%20at%20zero%20and)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19108#:~:text=,after%20a%20fixed%20number%20of). This allows self-replication to emerge: a program can copy its 64-byte sequence into another tape by moving the heads and using the copy instructions[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19108#:~:text=,after%20a%20fixed%20number%20of). The publicly released CuBFF code (Apache-2.0 licensed) contains the exact interpreter used in the experiments[github.com](https://github.com/paradigms-of-intelligence/cubff#:~:text=CuBFF), and the accompanying paper’s pseudocode and descriptions (as discussed above) mirror what that code does. Blaise and his team have thus provided both the conceptual blueprint and the actual source code for this experiment, demonstrating how simple rules at the code level – concatenating tapes, executing with self-referential instructions, and allowing self-modification – can give rise to complex, lifelike behavior in a computational medium.
