# DOC MIGRATION PLAN

- You are MIGRATING DOCUMENT DATA. DO NOT CREATE NEW FILES, I HAVE LAID OUT THE DOCUMENT STRUCTURE FOR YOU. THE CURRENT FILES HAVE BEEN MIGRATED PROPERLY, BUT REQUIRE COMPREHENSIVE UPDATING OF THEIR CONTENTS.

1. Review:
@0.1.1
    1.a)  All docs require updated data to bring them up to speed with the 0.1.1 spec and additions
    1.b) the appropriate files have been moved FROM `0.1.0` -> `0.1.1` directory for migration, LEGACY tag has been added to the deprecated 0.1.0 files.

2. DocumentReview: UPDATE THE DATA IN THE DOCUMENTS 
    2.a) @interaction-logic.md # logic inside the M|inc design
    2.b) @integration-plan.md # referencing the plan to integrate to the source code @python 
    2.c) @modules.md # referencing all python module planned integrations
    2.d) @incentives.md # the foundations of the M|inc system

3. DatabaseReview:
    3.b)@agents.csv @events_log.csv @events.csv @run_ticks.json @ticks.json @nameTypes.yaml 


4.  Maintain a: @nameTypes  file, select a schema that best suits our use case at the @database directory

CREATE A MIGRATION PLAN TO COVER ALL STEPS
 END_GOAL: "ALL DATA IN 0.1.1 SHOULD BE UP TO DATE WITH THE NEW FEATURE AND DESIGN SPEC" 
NOTES: "ENSURE EACH STEP IS SEPERATED INTO MANAGEABLE PROCESSES FOR THE AGENT. THE AGENT SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON LARGE EXPONENTIAL UPDATES OF A TARGETED FILE. MEANING THEY SHOULD FOCUS ALL GENERATION ON ONE WHILE, WHILE SEEKING CONTEXT FROM MULTIPLE OTHERS. NEVER HAVE ONE FILE TARGETED FOR EDITING AT ONCE. ALWAYS HAVE MULTIPLE CONTEXT FILES TARGETED TO EDIT ONE FILE.
